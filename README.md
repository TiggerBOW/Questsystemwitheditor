# QuestsystemwitheditorUnity
You can create a simple quest system within Unity, complete with user interfaces. You have the ability to create both main quests and sub-quests, 
and you can rearrange them using interfaces (editor tools). Moreover, if you have a large number of quests and can't find a specific one, you can easily search for it. 
You can create quests in the form of ScriptableObjects.
